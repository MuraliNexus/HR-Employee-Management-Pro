# 🗄️ Entity Relationships

## Employee ↔ Department

### Many-To-One

Many Employees belong to one Department.

```java
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "dept_id")
private Department department;
```

---

## Employee ↔ Address

### One-To-One

One Employee has one Address.

```java
@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
@JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
private Address address;
```

---

## Employee ↔ Project

### Many-To-Many

One Employee can work on multiple Projects and one Project can have multiple Employees.

```java
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(...)
private List<Project> projects;
```

# 📖 Pagination

Supports page-based data retrieval.

Example:

```http
GET /App/filter?pageNo=1&pageSize=5
```

Benefits:

* Faster API responses
* Reduced memory usage
* Better user experience

---

# ↕️ Sorting

Supports dynamic sorting.

Example:

```http
GET /App/filter?sortBy=name&sortDir=ASC
```

or

```http
GET /App/filter?sortBy=id&sortDir=DESC
```

---

# 🔍 Dynamic Filtering

Implemented using:

```java
Specification<Employee>
```

Supported Filters:

* Employee ID
* Employee Name
* Department Name
* City
* State
* Project Name

Example:

```http
GET /App/filter?name=Murali
```

```http
GET /App/filter?city=Chennai
```

```http
GET /App/filter?projectName=SpringBoot
```

Multiple filters can be combined.

Example:

```http
GET /App/filter?name=Murali&city=Chennai
```

---

# 🎯 Spring Data JPA Specifications

Dynamic queries are generated using:

```java
CriteriaBuilder
CriteriaQuery
Predicate
Specification
```

Benefits:

* Flexible filtering
* Cleaner repository layer
* Scalable query construction
